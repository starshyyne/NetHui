This is because the programme is set by you - the community who want to attend.</p><p>Our first consultation has been completed where we asked about theming and keynote speaker ideas. We are currently working our way through the feedback.</p><p>In a few months we will open another consultation where you&rsquo;ll have the chance to tell us what specific topics you want to see at NetHui 2017 and suggest a topic you might like to run a session on. You&rsquo;ll also get a chance to let us know if you would like to facilitate a session. Check back here for more information about this process.</p></div>
