We&rsquo;re not a conference and speakers won&rsquo;t talk at you all day. NetHui is a community event &ndash; made for the community, by the community.</p><p>Participation and collaboration are at the heart of NetHui. The programme isn&rsquo;t decided by InternetNZ &ndash; it&rsquo;s designed by the community. NetHui is about issues that actually matter to your community.</p><h4>Is NetHui for me?</h4><p>Of course! NetHui is for everybody that wants to talk about the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>NetHui is open and diverse. We aim to provide a safe space for everybody &ndash; regardless of age, occupation, gender, ethnicity, or background &ndash; to come together and talk. We expect everyone to have a respectful, open attitude. We also have a <a href="/zeppelin/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>â€‹ that all participants agree to adhere to.</p><p>Put simply, if you&rsquo;re looking for a safe, open, inclusive space to engage with your community about the Internet and all that goes with it, then NetHui will be your kind of place.</p><h4>What do I have to do at NetHui?&nbsp;</h4><p>You have many choices. You can come along and listen to the conversations. And you also have the chance to participate as little or as much as you like. It&rsquo;s all about listening, learning and participating at a level that feels right for you.</p><p>If there are topics you would love to talk about, there are chances for you to facilitate a session or help someone out doing so. See the get involved tab for more information.</p><p>However, we understand that centre-stage isn&rsquo;t for everybody, and there&rsquo;s heaps of other ways to be involved. You can come by in person and attend the one day events or you can get involved in the conversation online. The events will be live-streamed, and we will have a live-chat set-up so if you&rsquo;re watching from afar you&rsquo;ll still be able to participate. People will also be making collaborative notes of the sessions.</p><p>If you are unsure, register to come along and see what NetHui is all about. You can participate as little or as much as you like. It&rsquo;s your event and this is why it&rsquo;s so well loved. &nbsp;</p><p>If this all sounds like you, you can <a href="/zeppelin/register/">register here.&nbsp;</a></p></div>
